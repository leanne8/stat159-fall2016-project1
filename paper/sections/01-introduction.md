In Stat 159 (Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science), we focus on the importance of reproducible data and project. So far, we learned the basic computational tools to reproduce a project. First, we learned about bash where users types commands that cause actions in the terminal. Second, we learned about markdown syntax. Markdown is very useful for README file and it is a simplier version of HTML. Third, we learn about pandoc where it can convert from one format of file to another format. Pandoc is very useful for quick file type conversion. Then, we moved on to git and github. Git is a version control and github is a place where users can store their projects and collabrate a project with others. Next, we learned about make. Make is a way to organize files and it rely heavily on dependencies. Make only updates the files that are dependent for the target. After explaining how each tool works, I will tie in how these tools work with reproducible workflow.
