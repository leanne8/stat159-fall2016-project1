In Stat 159 (Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science), we focus on the importance of reproducible data and project. So far, we learned the basic computational tools to reproduce a project. First, we learned about bash where users types linux commands that cause actions in the terminal. Second, we learned about markdown syntax. Markdown is very useful for README file and it is a substitution of HTML. Third, we learned about pandoc where it can convert from one file format to another format. Pandoc is very useful for quick conversion of file type. Then, we moved on to git and github. Git is a version control which record changes of files. Github is a place where users can store their projects and collaborate a project with others under git. Lastly, we learned about makefile. Makefile is an easy way to organize files and it rely heavily on dependencies. Make only updates the files that are dependent for the target. After explaining how each tool works in details, I will tie in how these tools work with reproducible workflow.
