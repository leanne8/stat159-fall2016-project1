**1. Explain what is a Makefile and the role it plays in this reproducible workflow**

Makefile is used for organizing code. Make command help users to compile files and to produce an output file from multiple files. Make updates necessary files that need to be keep up-to-date. First, the user need to put a Makefile in a directory. Within the Makefile, the user can define the output files in all. Users defines a target, which is the name of a file that is generated by a program. Next to the target, users need to put the prerequisite or dependency files. Those files are used to generate the target file. After writing the target and prerequisites, users can define the recipe, which is the rules to generate the target files using prerequisites files. If there is multiple prerequisite files, the user can concatenate all the files to produce a target file. At the end, there is a clean target in the Makefile. Clean is used for deleting certain executable files. In a nutshell, users have a Makefile inside a directory. Within the makefile, users listed the prerequisites files that used for generating target files. The main targets is listed in all. The users can use the command of make clean to clear out the executable output files before running the make command again. Make saves a lot of time because the make command can recompile and update files. Make also have many shortcut patterns. Users can define a global variables inside Makefile and use $(variable) to reduce typing. Makefile also comes with different patterns and wildcards. For instance, $< means first prerequisites and $@ means target files. In reproducible workflow, make is efficient because the users don't have to type in the commands each time to recompile. Make will look like all dependency files and update the ones that are needed. 

**2. Explain what is Git, and its role in this reproducible workflow.**

Git is a version control system that helps users to organized code. Git have many useful commands such as add, commit, branch, merge and more. Users can create different branches and merge them into the master branch. Then users can pull the most updated version of everyone's committed work. Git helps keep track of changes with the history log. After committing the changes into git, users can backtrack the committed history and restore it at any time. It minimize the risk of losing code due to a failure of server.
The first step of git is to set up a repository by using git init. It creates .git inside of the project root and it contains metadata for the repo. If you want to work on an existing git repository, then the users should use git clone. After you work on your project for a while, you can add a change to the staging area by using git add. Git add acts as a temporary file in the staging area because it doesn’t update the file until the users commit the changes. Users can add a particular file or a directory. When the users want to update the changes, the users can use git commit. It is always recommended to add a message along with git commit -m “message”. Git status can track the unstaged files. Lastly, git push is to transfer commits from my local repository to the remote repository. In reproducible workflow, git is efficient because it only saves the change of the project instead of a new copy each time. Git is also efficient when developers collaborate on a project because they can easily merge from different branches into the master branch. 

**3. Explain what is GitHub, and its role in this project.**

Github is a web platform with the version control system of git. It is a place where users can store their projects and they are able to collaborate with other users. Users can create a repository where they store all the files of a project. If the repository is private, you can keep the code just to yourself and your collaborators. If the repository is public, other users can work on the existing project by forking a repo. Github allow users to keep their code in one place. In this project, I made a repository named stat159-fall2016-project1. I initialize the project in my local computer and I am able to commit changes in the remote repo. When I logon to github website, I am able to view all my repositories and the history of commit for all the projects. I can also give permission on certain users to change my projects. 


**4. Explain what is pandoc, and comment on its usefulness (or advantages).**

Pandoc is a command line tool for document conversion. In class, we talked about converting markdown files to html, latex, pdf and docx. Pandoc also support many other file types. The advantage of pandoc is to be able to another document types without manually translate into it. For instance, pandoc allows user to convert from markdown to LaTex. Even if the user has no experience with LaTax, pandoc can still do the conversion as long as the user has LaTex installed. With the varieties of pandoc, users can create beautiful documents. 

**5. Explain what is Markdown.**

Markdown is a tool to display writing on the web. It is similar to HTML but the learning curve is a lot easier. Markdown is especially useful in the README.md file in Github project. Markdown can format headers, create bullet list, include images and more. It can also style words as bold and italic and including links.
