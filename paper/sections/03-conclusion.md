**What resources you used to get the job done?**

Stack Overflow to debug some coding errors while doing the Makefile.

**What were the "easy" parts?**

The easy parts are bash commands and git. I learned those commands in CS courses.

**What were the challenging parts?**

The challenging part is to use wildcard in Markfile.

**What things you were stuck with?**

I was trying to use wildcard for all the file ending in md. However, my code got stuck and it couldnâ€™t concatenate the files. Later on, I went to office hour and Sindhuji helped me to figure out the error.


**What was the most time consuming part?**

The most time consuming part is to complete the makefile tutorials. But after doing the demo from the tutorials, I am able to understand Makefile very well. 

**Did you work with and/or get help from someone else? If yes, in what manner?**
**How much time did it take?**

I worked on this project by myself, but I also got help from Sindhuji regarding the wildcard in Makefile. The entire project took about 4 - 5 hours to complete.
