## Conlcusion

This essay covered the main topics of Stat 159 I learned so far. While writing the paper, I used a few resources to write this paper. I mainly used the lecture notes and some supported documents in the website to write this paper. In addition, I used Alassian git tutorial and markdown cheatsheet because they give a very detailed description. While working on the Makefile, I encountered a few coding errors and I used Stack Overflow to find solutions. 

The easy parts are the bash commands and git because I learned those commands in other classes. I also found it easy to download images. The challenging parts is to use wildcard in the Markfile. 

TI was trying to use wildcard for all the file ending in md. However, my code got stuck and it couldnâ€™t concatenate the files. Later on, I went to office hour and Sindhuji helped me to figure out the error.

The most time consuming part is to complete the makefile tutorials. But after doing the demo from the tutorials, I am able to understand Makefile very well. 

I worked on this project by myself, but I also got help from Sindhuji regarding the wildcard in Makefile. The entire project took about 5 -7 hours to complete.
